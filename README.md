# DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM

These were that the assignments that we have done during our third semester of Engineering for the course Data Structure and Algorithm 2


## JON SNOW - THE KING OF NORTH

Jon Snow is fighting with White walkers on a narrow bridge that connects north and south. Currently, on the bridge, there are three White walkers with health indexes a, b and c respectively. The health index is a positive integer that indicates how healthy is the white walker.

Jon Snow holds the sword of dragons that never misses a cut against white walkers. When ever Jon Snow wields the dragon sword, it cuts exactly one white walker and reduces its health index by one point. Note that jon Snow cannot cut a dead White walker (with health index 0). Since Jon Snow is the seventh king of The North, every seventh cut (i,e 7-th, 14-th,21-st etc) is an enhanced cut that can reduce the health index of all three White walkers by one.

Jon Snow wants to cross the bridge heroically, i. e., kill all the White walkers with the same enhanced cut. Given the health index of the three White walkers, check whether Jon Snow can cross the bridge heroically.

## SMALLEST NUMBER

Here is an interesting challenge with numbers. You are given the digits of a positive decimal integer along with the number of digits it contains. You are expected to find the integer formed using the same digits which is less than the given integer. However, no other integer formed using the same digits should lie between the integer found by you and the original integer.

## FUN WITH AVL

Here is a simple problem involving AVL trees. First, you will have to create an AVL tree by starting with a blank tree and performing a series of insertions and deletions of nodes based on their keys as given in the command line. If the key to be removed is not present in the AVL tree or if the key to be inserted is already present in the AVL tree, ignore the key; it is a no-op. Thereafter, for every node whose key is given in the next command line, you should print,

1. the height of the node.
2. the min, max, and average of all keys in the subtree rooted at that node.
